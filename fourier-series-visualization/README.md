# Fourier series visualization

In directory [fourier-series](fourier-series) is my implementation of Fourier series visualizer. It takes any enclosed curve drawn by the user and calculates coefficients for Fourier series that would best approximate the curve, if we look at it as a function $f: [0,1] \rightarrow \mathbb{C}$.

It consist of three main classes:

- `FourierSeriesViusualizer` - responsible for graphical interface
- `FourierSeriesCalculator` - responsible for all necessary calculations related to Fourier series
- `Complex` - representation of a complex number with all basic operations

More complex description can be found in Javadoc HTML documentation [javadoc](fourier-series-doc/index.html) generated by IntelliJ IDEA.

Visualizer can be launched by running:

```shell
java --module-path $PATH_TO_FX --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml -cp fourier-series/target/classes fourier_series.FourierSeriesVisualizer
```

`$PATH_TO_FX` is a variable with path to the `lib` directory in your JavaFX SDK.

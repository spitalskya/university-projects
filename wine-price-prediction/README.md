# Wine price prediction

A more detailed description is available in the [report](report.pdf).  

This project implements linear regression models using linear programming techniques with objective function calculated using the $L_1$ and $L_\infty$ norms. The implementation is used to predict the wine price based on several statistics.

## Overview

The project consists of:

1. **Mathematical Formulation**: The regression problem is formulated as a linear programming task, its satisfiability and existence of optimal solution is proven.
2. **Visualization**: The model's functionality is visualized on 2D data to demonstrate how the regression line fits the data points.
3. **Wine Price Prediction**: The $L_1$ and $L_\infty$ regression models are applied to predict wine prices based on a dataset containing various factors influencing the wine quality.

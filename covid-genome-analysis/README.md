# Covid genome analysis

This project analyzes the quality of genomic sequencing data, focusing on factors influencing sequencing accuracy. Our goal was to identify relationships between estimated quality and other variables, detect trends affecting quality, and investigate potential improvements in sequencing methodologies.  

Key aspects of the analysis include:

- Examining correlations between estimated quality and sequencing factors  
- Assessing the impact of non-target organisms on sequencing accuracy  
- Investigating batch-related quality fluctuations and their potential causes  
- Identifying trends in the reference genome that may indicate the need for PCR primer redesign
